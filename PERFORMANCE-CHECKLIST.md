## Testing Commands
```bash
# Run performance audit
npm run performance:lighthouse

# Analyze bundle size
npm run bundle:analyze

# Check image optimization
npm run optimize:images

# Monitor performance
npm run performance:check
```

## Production Deployment
- Ensure all optimizations are active in production
- Monitor Core Web Vitals with real user data
- Set up alerts for performance regressions
- Regular performance audits and optimization reviews
